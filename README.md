# A-Whale-off-the-Port-folio-
Python-pandas homework assignment 

In this assignment,  I made substantial use of pandas functionality to compare a variety of portfolio strategies. I started by reading csv files containing securities closing prices and cleaning the data, including resetting the datetime indexes. The closing prices were converted to daily percentage returns and dataframes were created. I used the daily percentage series contained in the dataframes to run risk/return analysis and enable a comparison of all portfolios. Statistical properties of the data were also plotted in graphs to facilate visual comparison of the strategies. Conclusions were drawn and elaborated upon based on the analytical results and graphical displays exhibited on the script.
